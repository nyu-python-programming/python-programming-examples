For beginners.

## Install dependencies

Dependencies are listed in both `Pipfile` and `requirements.txt` for use with `pipenv` and `pip`, respectively.

- To install with `pipenv`, first make sure [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) is installed, then run `pipenv install` and then `pipenv shell`.
- To install with `pip`, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
